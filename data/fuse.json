Her at the time acquaintance [[Shelia|people.npc.shelia]] would seek her out to see about starting a [[small camp|places.shelias-camp]] to pool resources and protect one another.\n\nEventually, some time after camp had been established. On a foraging excursion she would come across a severely injured Eevee, reminding her of the other children in Asterim, she would take in who she would later know as [[Azalea|people.npc.azalea]].\n\nShe currently resides in [[Shelia's Camp|places.shelias-camp]], alongside [[Shelia|people.npc.shelia]] [[Azalea|people.npc.azalea]] and others.\n\n## Personality\nAkko is motherly and sometimes overbearing when one is injured, caring for everyone's wellbeing. She offers a comforting presence and is always willing to help out those hurt, provided of course they haven't harmed any of her friends. She can whip up a meal from seemingly nothing.\n\n## Relationships\nAkko tries to care for everyone, this could be seen as a flaw as she is quick to trust. But get on her bad side, and its not going to be pleasant for you.\n\n### Vincent\nWhen discovering Vincent in the woods, Akko would attempt to help him as best she could. Learning that he had forgotten everything, she took it as a sign to care for him as best she could. Eventually he would in confidence share that he was human. She was initially shocked, but it was quickly abated by the trust they shared. Their relationship would grow to one that at first glance would seem deeply romantic but was in fact immense appreciation of one another's sacrifices.\n\nTheir time together would form a deep, inseverable bond. Battling in tandem and seemingly reading one another's mind in battle. She understands the trust Vincent instills in her.\n\n### Shelia\nBefore The Great Tremor, Akko would meet Shelia on several community meetings about the town. They saw each other as good acquaintances. Deciding on new shops, the construction of new buildings, etcetera.\n\nAfter The Great Tremor, Akko would come to know Shelia more personally, out of necessity, to form a small camp. Relying on Shelia's strength, and companionship.\n\n### Azalea\nThe relationship with Azalea can be seen as a mother-daughter relationship. Akko occasionally dotes on Azalea much to the latter's embarrassment. Teaching her to forage, and scavenge to much futility, as Azalea is quite clumsy.\n\n## Current\nCurrently, Akko acts as a Mayor for the budding settlement of [[places.duskalos]].

Attempting to provide a central hub for rescue teams to quickly and easily obtain resources, quests, and in some cases even housing for team members.

Most board members would either Retire or were K.I.A. before being voted off.\n\nWhile rescue teams were running seemingly rampant with a new one every day, the RTA provided a sense of relief among the general populace. Policing members, and ensuring they adhere to a code of conduct. The mission statement being \"Always help within your means. Don't over do it.\"\n\n## Ranking\nThe RTA had a very rudimentary Ranking system that was largely based on notoriety or skill. Having a higher rank gave you a larger voice in Alliance meetings.

If you have any questions at any point about certain mechanics please let me know and I will do my best to explain them! Things may change as we play! It can be confusing for all of us, but I will attempt to streamline the game as best as possible so we can have the most fun possible!\n\n# Combat\nCombat is a harsh pill to swallow and this game is made on a non grid system. Mostly using Theater of the Mind, and not regarding any logic to actual movement/range whatsoever, I have changed this so it is more in-line with traditional TTRPG Mechanics. This may change as I notice balance issues arise.\n\nFirst up. Movement Speed. Your movement speed is equal to your Size class. The categories are as follows:\n\n|Effective Height|Size Class|Speed|\n|-|-|-|\n|2 Feet and Under |Tiny|20 Ft.|\n|2 to 3 Feet|Small|25 Ft.|\n|3 to 5 Feet|Medium|30 Ft.|\n|6 Feet and Above|Large|35 Ft.|\n<br/>\nIn Addition to this, if your character has the ability to fly, Add an Additional 5 foot of movement speed. And you gain the Size class speed as your flight speed. (For example. If you are an Emolga, You are Tiny, you have a Movement speed of 25 because you can fly. Your Fly Speed is 20)\n\n## Moving in Combat\n\nYou may *Dash* (full movements) equal to your Dexterity score to a max of 5 (so if you have 6 dex, you can only make 5 dashes). Movement will take priority over all actions, making subsequent actions harder. You can elect to move at the end of your turn. But you can only move normally.\n\nFor Example:\nYour Dex is 2. Your Movement speed is 30. You can make 60 total movement, and that counts as 2/5 actions for this particular round.\n\n## Attacking Move range\nPhysical moves have a range of 5 feet.\nPhys + Multi foes are 10 feet\nIf a move is labeled as ranged, it has 30 feet.\n\nSpecial Moves have a range of 60 feet.\nSpec + Multi foes are an additional +10ft per foe (unless its all in range in which case 80 ft)\n\nMoves that target the battlefield are a 90 ft. radius.\n\n# Saving Throws\nSometimes when the going gets rough, you need to lay all the cards out on the table.\n\nSaving throws are rolls that are to be used when doing risky things. Jumping off a cliff, or putting everything into a single attack! These rolls will always be a Raw attribute roll, and it is the only roll where you add up all the face values of the dice (No pass/fail).\n\n# Skill Checks\nA Skill check consists of one to two components. Generally an Attribute/Social Attribute and/or a Skill. When rolling the dice, Add the two pools together, roll the necessary dice, and call out how many successes you’ve obtained.\n\nA Skill Check will **ALWAYS** be at least 1 Attribute and/or Skill. They can be more for a **MAX** of 2 pools. In some cases it can be 2 attributes or skills.\n\nThis flexibility allows you to try things that aren’t listed on your sheet as written! Say you want to try to determine what move a Pokémon just used! You can attempt a \"Magic\" check by combining Special + Channel!\n\nIf you want to try something weird go for it! I will generally let you know what you need to roll!\n\nAchieving all successes (where all the dice read successes), is considered a Critical Success (Equivalent to a Nat 20).\n\n## Critical Success\nOn a skill check, Achieving Successes on All of your Dice, is considered the equivalent to a Natural 20 in D&D terms. This only applies to rolls where you roll 3 or more dice. ^ww33jdu5l3j4\n\nFor example, If you roll a skill check for stealth, but only have 2 dice to roll, you cannot critically succeed. \nAnother example. If you roll a skill check for Perception (Insight + Nature). And have 4 dice to roll, you can critically succeed! ^aor8ncn2ouqy\n\n# Logic, Instinct, and Primal\nThis section of the PMD Module is outdated as the module was originally made for 1.0 of the Pokerole rule set. I am following a homebrew ruleset to bring this more in line with 2.0.\n\n## Logic\nFirstly, Logic is now used to help determine the amount of dice you need for Logic based skill roles (Medical checks, Weaponry checks, Etc.) Everyone starts off with a single point in this field.\n\n## Instinct\nInstinct will now affect multiple things! For starters, The amount of ranks you have in Instinct will determine what level of moves you can learn (1 for starter, 2 for beginner, 3 for amateur, 4 for ace, and 5 for pro). You can also use Instinct in place of a Nature check for Food or Shelter (only in this case). \n\nFinally the amount of Instinct points you have will determine how much HP you recover when using a point of Primal. Everyone starts with a single point in this field.\n\nYou get an additional point to place in either Logic or Instinct as you please.\n\n## Primal\nPrimal has the biggest revamp. Rather than a game-ender as written in the PMD module it is now a resource you can pull on when your back is against the wall.\n\nEveryone is down, you’re the last one standing in the face of this monster, you’re beaten and bloodied, but you must survive. You pull on something deep within you, disobeying everything in you to run, you take a deep breath, scream as if to defy the world itself, and take your last stand.\n\nEveryone starts with 0 Primal. You add 1 to Primal as you spend a point, to a max of 5. When spending a point you regain HP equal to your Instinct score and clear all status conditions.\n\nIf you use all 5 points of Primal. In the round you triggered it you will pass out when everything resolves. ^dvatxa0csgoe\n\n# Common Skill Checks\n\n# Custom Actions\nBelow are a list of custom actions used in the campaign that everyone has access to.\n## Snap out of it!\nOnce per round, you may attempt to snap a party member out of their confusion or infatuation by attempting a non-damaging slap to them. `Insight + Alert` Success DC equal to the initial accuracy of the move.","n":0.031}}},{"i":49,"$":{"0":{"v":"Player Add-on Resource","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n# Scope\nThe goal of this document is to integrate certain functions of the Pokerole system and the PMD Add-on module within the D&D 5E system. It will largely express the current problems I have with the current Pokerole system and hope to address them. This will be run in sections to explain each core concept of both 5E and Pokerole, how they are planned to be merged, as well as a conversion system for the Moves.\n\nFor context this will only assume the setting is for the PMD Add-on and all player characters will be assuming the role of Pokemon.\n\n---\n\n# Character Creation\nFor the process of character creation, you'll largely follow the process of 5E for creating a character. Depending on your DM's preference of either Point Buy or Rolls. \n\nThere are exceptions. Due to the nature of Magic using classes and Pokemon, it's advised that they be avoided where possible. As most magic casting could be replaced for Pokemon using Moves.\n\n## 5E Specific Stats\nFor this, Use [This site](https://pokedex-5e.herokuapp.com/) but ignore references to Moves, this is an incomplete list. Take note of the Hit Die and Movement Speeds and Size Class, which is required for the remainder of your character creation. \n\n---\n\n# Pokemon Moves\nThis will heavily utilize the Pokerole rulebook, with adaptations to 5E. See the table below for Equivalent Attributes.\n\n## Move Points\nThis is a Universal Feature for all Pokemon. It allows you to use moves from the Pokerole Handbook in the 5E system in an attempt to balance both D&D AND Pokerole systems in tandem.\n\n Move Points (MP) uses the following equation to obtain the total.  \n $INT\\ Modifier +  Proficiency\\ Bonus = Move\\ Points$\n\n## Move Conversion\nThis section will cover how to Convert a move.\n\n#### Equivalent Attributes\n|Pokerole|D&D 5E|\n|-:|:-|\n|Strength|Strength|\n|Dexterity|Dexterity|\n|Vitality|Constitution|\n|Special|Intelligence|\n|Insight|Wisdom|\n|Social Attributes[^1]|Charisma|\n[^1]:Social attributes in this case are **Tough**, **Cool**, **Beauty**, **Cute**, and **Clever**. These are all rolled into the Charisma stat.\n\n#### Equivalent Ranks\n|Pokerole Rank|D&D CL|\n|-:|:-|\n|Starter|1-2|\n|Beginner|3-4|\n|Amateur|5-6|\n|Ace|7-8|\n|Pro|9-10|\n|Master|11+|\n\n<br/>\n\nThe moves a pokemon may learn are equal to their CL + INT Modifier.\nThe Level of theses moves are also determined by CL using rank conversion (See Below).\n\n\n### Using Moves\nAll moves are run against the AC of your opponent. To use a move Roll a 20-sided die and add the appropriate Attribute from the move's accuracy pool. Using the following Formulae\n\n*To Hit:*  \n$D20\\ +\\ Move\\ Attribute\\ \\geq\\ AC$\n\n*For Damage:*  \n$Hit\\ Die\\ +\\ Damage\\ Pool\\ Attribute = Total\\ Damage$\n\nBelow is an example using the move Tackle.\n<details>\n<summary>Tackle usage example</Summary>\n\n![Tackle. Power 2. Type Normal. Accuracy Pool, Dexterity+Brawl. Damage Pool, Strength+2.](image.png)\n\nSeen above is the card for the move Tackle. When rolling to hit, take the Accuracy pool, and drop the Skill portion of it (Usually the second value), and Match it with the appropriate base Attribute.\n\nIf you hit, Roll the damage pool using your Hit Die + the Listed Attribute. (If no attribute is listed for the move or if the move specifies a specific damage type, just roll your hit die with no modifiers. Unless the move has Set Damage, Apply Damage as normal.)\n\nThe formulae below is how this is calculated.  \nTo Hit:  \n$\nD20 + DEX\\ Modifier\\ \\geq\\ AC \n$\n\nFor Damage:  \n$\nHit\\ Die + Damage\\ Pool = Total\\ Damage\n$\n\n#### Example\nIn a greater example. lets say you have a D&D Dexterity of 14 and Strength of 16. this would give you a +2 and +3 respectively as modifiers. And your Hit Die is a d8\n\nYou want to use the move Tackle, Roll to hit against the opponents AC, You rolled a 14 add the 2 from your DEX for a total of 16 to hit!  \n$D20=14+DEX\\ Mod\\ 2=16\\ To\\ Hit$\n\nThe attack hits! you roll a D8 for damage and add your STR. You rolled a 7 for a total of 10!  \n$D8=7 + STR\\ Mod 3 = 10\\ Damage$\n\n#### Special Cases\nIn the event the move you want to use uses a Social Attribute (see [^1]) you simply replace it with your Charisma Modifier.\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n### Weakness, Resistance, and STAB\nThis section will cover how to calculate for your weakness, resistance, and STAB.  \n**Subject to Change.**\n\n#### Weakness\nIf you are weak against a certain move you take more damage than you normally would (+2, and +4 in cases of Double Super Effective.)\n\n#### Resistance\nIf you resist a certain move you take less damage (-2, and -4 in cases of Double Not Very Effective, unless you are immune in which you take no damage)\n\n#### STAB\nSame Type Attack Bonus will let you add your Proficency Bonus to hit.\n\n## Summary\nTo Summarize, take the desired move from the Pokerole Handbook. Roll to hit against the AC, adding the appropriate stats from the accuracy field and if you have STAB add your Proficiency bonus to the roll. If the hit is successful, roll your Hit Die + Move Modifiers. Spend a Move Point.\n\n---\n\n# Homebrew Variant Rules\nI tend to disagree with the WotC and Pokerole on certain things. Below you can find the Rule Variants I use in my game.\n\n## Death Saves (Variant)\nRoll death saves as normal. However taking damage does not constitute an auto-fail. For every 5 points (after DR) of damage you take, increase the Death Save DC by 1 for that round.\n\n## Difficulty Class Gradient\nDue to my DMing Style, I am a Narrative First DM, meaning above all else, the story, the player's interactions with the world, and how the world reacts around them, come first.\n\nIn \"Rules as Written\" DC checks are largely you either Hit the DC or you fail. Frankly speaking, this sucks. and I much prefer utilizing this variant rule.\n\nWhen interacting with an NPC, if you do not succeed the skill check *but fall within a few points short* things will swing in your favor, but not entirely. Just because you didn't pass the check doesn't mean your words did nothing.\n\nThis rule will be applied at the DMs discretion and when it applies will be largely unknown to the player for full immersion.\n\n\n## Primal\nA Universal Feature that All Pokemon have.\n\n### Trait\n*When your back is against the wall, you need to stand tall, for one final hit.*\n\nWhen you reach Zero hit points, Before you go down, but after you take the hit points, as a Reaction, you can spend a Primal point to restore 1d6+Con Mod of HP, Restore 1 point to all class and racial abilities, and if applicable 1 spell slot of your choice. In addition, you are still standing and still have any applicable actions on your turn. You can use this ability Twice per combat.\n\nThe amount of Primal you have will be equal to your STR Mod + CON Mod. When an encounter ends, you will immediately fall unconscious and fall to 1 HP regardless of whether or not you were healed, due to the strain it took on your body. You regain 1 Primal point per long rest.\n\nUpon spending your last point of Primal your damage is Doubled (Times 2). However at the end of combat you will fall to Zero HP and roll Death Saves.\n\n\n[^2]:*[CL]: Character Level \n*[WIS]: Wisdom Modifier\n*[DEX]: Dexterity Modifier\n*[STR]: Strength Modifier\n*[INT]: Intelligence Modifier\n*[CON]: Constitution Modifier\n*[DC]: Difficulty Class\n*[AC]: Armor Class\n*[STAB]: Same Type Attack Bonus\n*[DR]: Damage Reduction\n*[MP]: Move Point(s)","n":0.029}}},{"i":50,"$":{"0":{"v":"Making a PMD Character","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"The character creation process is spread out all over the CRB and PMD Add-on.
