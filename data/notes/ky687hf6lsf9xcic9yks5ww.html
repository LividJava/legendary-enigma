<p>Contrary to popular belief, Iris, should you have the unfortunate chance to meet her, is a Ferrier of Souls. Bringing those who've perished to the afterlife.</p>
<p>Her appearance is only seen by Pok√©mon to ferry them alone. She does not appear before humans on their own demise.</p>
<p>Her demeanor can seem unsettling or off-putting. She is the name those dread to hear. Names written down in legend.</p>
<p>There is only one person known to have met Iris, and return.</p>
