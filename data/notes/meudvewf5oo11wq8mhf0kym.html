<p>The Wondrous World (Undr Öld) exists outside of human contact, both impossible to observe and impossible to reach physically.</p>
<p>The human world's contact with Undr Öld would be detrimental to both the environment, and the human world. </p>
<p><strong>Humans must never be able to touch this land. Doing so would spell disaster for all the residents of the island.</strong></p>
<p>While it is said that pokémon and humans live in harmony this island is what it would be like if <em>humans did not exist</em>. that isn't to say they don't exist at all, as said above, they must not reach this island. Doing so would upset the delicate balance created in which pokémon thrive alone outside of human contact.</p>
<h2 id="society">Society<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#society"></a></h2>
<p>The island is largely apolitical. The closest thing to politics are terrorital disputes, of which are generally solved peacefully with the two <a href="/notes/meudvewf5oo11wq8mhf0kym#settlements">Settlements</a> will eventually either move someplace else, fight between one another, or merge and become larger, pooling resources and communities.</p>
<h2 id="great-catastrophes">Great Catastrophes<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#great-catastrophes"></a></h2>
<p>The Great catastrophes are at large what dictates the setting of the current campaign. Segmented off into several natural disasters. <a href="/notes/fafzzrn2byyqw5ikkze2l9r">The Great Tremor</a>, <a href="/notes/397ftgwav35j8s57mhajse2">The Great Flood</a>, <a href="/notes/s9v791017mtduvbqkxnudeo">The Great Winds</a>, <a href="/notes/d1kaoy59g56k2mdr789vrvg">The Great Eruption</a> and lastly <a href="/notes/3yhg6tzccoyefbpz12yaky6">The Great Wave</a>.</p>
<p>The settlements and towns of the island consist entirely of various pokemon. Coming together, either be that by necessity, force, or willingness. They are all a part of the ecosystem at large.</p>
<h2 id="settlements">Settlements<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#settlements"></a></h2>
<p>Settlements are dotted everywhere throughout the island, and generally have a population size of >5-15 people.npc. Small and quaint, are mostly comprised of friends or families.</p>

<h2 id="towns">Towns<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#towns"></a></h2>
<p>Towns can be considered gathering hubs for large swaths of pokémon. They can easily reach the hundreds and have some form of trade present. They usually contain general shops, banks, or other things needed for passing travelers.</p>
