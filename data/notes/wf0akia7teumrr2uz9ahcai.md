The Great catastrophes are a series of events that happen in no particular order, but when they do occur they *all* have some form of devastating, and sometimes, irreparable damage. They may never cause the island itself to sink but they can cause massive changes to the land itself depending on the nature.

The Great Catastrophes are an anomalous result of the appearance of the [[World Fracture|world-fracture]].
