<p>Akko is a Spinda. A former dungeoneer and surrogate town mayor. A former member of the Rescue Team Novus, a team managed by <a href="/notes/2aui13hxma3m5os3ieccoq2">Vincent</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#history"></a></h2>
<p>Akko lived in a small settlement which would later become the town of <a href="/notes/1qv5bt0exb5d0j8bll46s25">Asterim</a>. Growing up she would busy herself with learning about first aid, cooking, and horticulture, developing a seemingly extraordinary ability to identify plants, their uses, and properties on mere sight. She would become the person all the children go to after getting cuts or scrapes, fostering her nurturing personality. </p>
<p>At some point while on the look for more herbs she would come across an unconscious Pikachu, whom she would later know as Vincent. While helping him come to, she would discover that he'd lost all his memories.</p>
<p>The pair would eventually found the Rescue Team Novus.

<p><a aria-hidden="true" class="block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link" id="^y065g0plpzvf" href="#^y065g0plpzvf"></a>He and Akko would split at some point to start the foundations of Asterim. While Akko would remain behind to manage the town as a surrogate mayor while he was away. Vincent and his team would go on to best several legendaries that threatened the land. </p>

<p>While acting as a surrogate mayor for Vincent, she would help manage new shops, community projects, as well as general infrastructure for the town, seeing it as an opportunity to expand her horizons. <a href="/notes/fafzzrn2byyqw5ikkze2l9r">The Great Tremor</a> would cause her to forcibly retire as Asterim would become ruined due to a poor foundation that was never resolved. Towns members would scatter. Her at the time acquaintance <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">Shelia (Private)</a> would seek her out to see about starting a <a href="/notes/nniyqfu2hjqy42jv8kw0abx">small camp</a> to pool resources and protect one another.</p>
<p>Eventually, some time after camp had been established. On a foraging excursion she would come across a severely injured Eevee, reminding her of the other children in Asterim, she would take in who she would later know as <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">Azalea (Private)</a>.</p>
<p>She currently resides in <a href="/notes/nniyqfu2hjqy42jv8kw0abx">Shelia's Camp</a>, alongside <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">Shelia (Private)</a> <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">Azalea (Private)</a> and others.</p>
<h2 id="personality">Personality<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#personality"></a></h2>
<p>Akko is motherly and sometimes overbearing when one is injured, caring for everyone's wellbeing. She offers a comforting presence and is always willing to help out those hurt, provided of course they haven't harmed any of her friends. She can whip up a meal from seemingly nothing.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#relationships"></a></h2>
<p>Akko tries to care for everyone, this could be seen as a flaw as she is quick to trust. But get on her bad side, and its not going to be pleasant for you.</p>
<h3 id="vincent">Vincent<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#vincent"></a></h3>
<p>When discovering Vincent in the woods, Akko would attempt to help him as best she could. Learning that he had forgotten everything, she took it as a sign to care for him as best she could. Eventually he would in confidence share that he was human. She was initially shocked, but it was quickly abated by the trust they shared. Their relationship would grow to one that at first glance would seem deeply romantic but was in fact immense appreciation of one another's sacrifices.</p>
<p>Their time together would form a deep, inseverable bond. Battling in tandem and seemingly reading one another's mind in battle. She understands the trust Vincent instills in her.</p>
<h3 id="shelia">Shelia<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#shelia"></a></h3>
<p>Before The Great Tremor, Akko would meet Shelia on several community meetings about the town. They saw each other as good acquaintances. Deciding on new shops, the construction of new buildings, etcetera.</p>
<p>After The Great Tremor, Akko would come to know Shelia more personally, out of necessity, to form a small camp. Relying on Shelia's strength, and companionship.</p>
<h3 id="azalea">Azalea<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#azalea"></a></h3>
<p>The relationship with Azalea can be seen as a mother-daughter relationship. Akko occasionally dotes on Azalea much to the latter's embarrassment. Teaching her to forage, and scavenge to much futility, as Azalea is quite clumsy.</p>
<h2 id="current">Current<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#current"></a></h2>
<p>Currently, Akko acts as a Mayor for the budding settlement of <a href="/notes/gcig1t4ovwoes9m0toqjk8r">Duskalos</a>. She filled in this role with ease given her history in <a href="/notes/1qv5bt0exb5d0j8bll46s25">Asterim</a>. She would go on to help Shinx, gather information about the currently missing Vincent.</p>
