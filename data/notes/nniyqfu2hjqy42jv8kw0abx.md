| Camp | Nomadic |
<br/>
A small fenced off, cozy, camp of survivors and friends. A small respite from the horrors of the world.

## Foundation
The camp was founded by Akko and Shelia shorty after the destruction of their hometown [[Asterim|places.asterim]]. The pair decided to pool together resources and protect one another.

This camp would eventually become resolved and merge with [[places.duskalos]].
