<p>After their adventures together. Magnolia was set on helping everyone they could as best as possible. After <a href="/notes/397ftgwav35j8s57mhajse2">The Great Flood</a> Magnolia would go on to found a small settlement of their own, in which all was welcome. Eventually becoming known to the local area as The Grand Healer, able to heal most if not all aliments. There are speculations about their ability to even bring fallen back from the dead.</p>
