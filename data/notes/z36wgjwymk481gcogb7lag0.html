<br>
While its founders are unknown. The Rescue Team Alliance (RTA) was heralded as a source for all up and coming adventurers to start. While membership was not mandatory, it was seen as a rather Unusual move for members to not be a part of the RTA
<h2 id="history">History<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#history"></a></h2>
<p>The RTA was founded as the need for rescue teams rose. Attempting to provide a central hub for rescue teams to quickly and easily obtain resources, quests, and in some cases even housing for team members. It quickly became apparent that those who were not RTA members would have a harder time if they wanted to make it as a rescue team.</p>
<p>Eventually there would be an appointed board that would manage fees, and other administrative tasks. Board members were voted onto the board with no set term length, they could be voted off and replaced. Most board members would either Retire or were K.I.A. before being voted off.</p>
<p>While rescue teams were running seemingly rampant with a new one every day, the RTA provided a sense of relief among the general populace. Policing members, and ensuring they adhere to a code of conduct. The mission statement being "Always help within your means. Don't over do it."</p>
<h2 id="ranking">Ranking<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#ranking"></a></h2>
<p>The RTA had a very rudimentary Ranking system that was largely based on notoriety or skill. Having a higher rank gave you a larger voice in Alliance meetings. High ranking members were considered the best of the best. The system was as follows</p>
<div class="table-responsive">








































<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Rank</th><th align="left">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">No Rank/Rookie</td><td align="left">New members started without a rank</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Bronze</td><td align="left">Teams in this rank have participated in a few assignments and have proven to be useful.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Silver</td><td align="left">Teams in this rank have saved entire towns from destruction.

They also participate in expeditions to continue to chart the world.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Master ★</td><td align="left">Teams in this rank manage lower ranking members, can help plan new expeditions and are the first ones to go when major trouble is afoot.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Master ★★</td><td align="left">Teams in this rank can create expeditions into new areas, and are generally the first to discover them.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Master ★★★</td><td align="left">The highest rank attainable, This was reserved for the teams who saved the world. Only two teams were known to have achieved this rank.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>Moving through the ranks was largely based on skill or notoriety however if you were to achieve an act of great heroism, chances were high you could skip ranks based on the act.</p>
