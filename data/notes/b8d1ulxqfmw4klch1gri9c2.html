<p>The character creation process is spread out all over the CRB and PMD Add-on. This guide has been made in an effort to consolidate this process. However, this is an incomplete/incorrect guide that only accounts for things in my personal campaigns.</p>
<h4 id="initial-stats">Initial Stats<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#initial-stats"></a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find your pokemon's statblock (CRB 88), note down Base HP, and the Base (Shaded) and Max (Unshaded) stats, note them down on your character sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put 1 Point in All of your Social Attributes, with 1 additional point to distribute as you please.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="skills--vitials">Skills &#x26; Vitials<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#skills--vitials"></a></h4>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Put 3 Points into your Skills, Distribute them as you please. see <a href="/notes/b8d1ulxqfmw4klch1gri9c2#logic-primal-and-instinct">here.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark down your HP which is Base HP + Vitality (VIT)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark down your Initiative which is Dexterity (DEX) + Alert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark down your Will which is Insight (INS) + 2. Mark those down.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The amount of moves you can learn is INS + 2 (same as Will.)</p>
<p>If you're following along for the base PMD module? Congrats (not included in this quick guide, Primal, Logic, and Instinct)! If it's for my Homebrew. Keep scrollin' y'ain't done yet.</p>
<h4 id="logic-primal-and-instinct">Logic Primal and Instinct<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#logic-primal-and-instinct"></a></h4>
<p><a aria-hidden="true" class="block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link" id="^lpi" href="#^lpi"></a>For Logic, Primal, and Instinct, follow the rules from the <a href="/notes/zw8zreiygnsgd6vsoayjpsf">Homebrew Add-on</a>. They will also be listed below. </p>
<p></p><p></p><div class="portal-container">

<div class="portal-parent-fader-bottom"></div><h2 id="logic">Logic<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#logic"></a></h2>
<p>Firstly, Logic is now used to help determine the amount of dice you need for Logic based skill roles (Medical checks, Weaponry checks, Etc.) Everyone starts off with a single point in this field.</p>
<h2 id="instinct">Instinct<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#instinct"></a></h2>
<p>Instinct will now affect multiple things! For starters, The amount of ranks you have in Instinct will determine what level of moves you can learn (1 for starter, 2 for beginner, 3 for amateur, 4 for ace, and 5 for pro). You can also use Instinct in place of a Nature check for Food or Shelter (only in this case). </p>
<p>Finally the amount of Instinct points you have will determine how much HP you recover when using a point of Primal. Everyone starts with a single point in this field.</p>
<p>You get an additional point to place in either Logic or Instinct as you please.</p>
<h2 id="primal">Primal<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#primal"></a></h2>
<p>Primal has the biggest revamp. Rather than a game-ender as written in the PMD module it is now a resource you can pull on when your back is against the wall.</p>
<p>Everyone is down, you’re the last one standing in the face of this monster, you’re beaten and bloodied, but you must survive. You pull on something deep within you, disobeying everything in you to run, you take a deep breath, scream as if to defy the world itself, and take your last stand.</p>
<p>Everyone starts with 0 Primal. You add 1 to Primal as you spend a point, to a max of 5. When spending a point you regain HP equal to your Instinct score and clear all status conditions.</p>
<p><a aria-hidden="true" class="block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link" id="^dvatxa0csgoe" href="#^dvatxa0csgoe"></a>If you use all 5 points of Primal. In the round you triggered it you will pass out when everything resolves. </p>
