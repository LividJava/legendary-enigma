The character creation process is spread out all over the CRB and PMD Add-on. This guide has been made in an effort to consolidate this process. However, this is an incomplete/incorrect guide that only accounts for things in my personal campaigns.

#### Initial Stats
1. Find your pokemon's statblock (CRB 88), note down Base HP, and the Base (Shaded) and Max (Unshaded) stats, note them down on your character sheet.

2. Put 1 Point in All of your Social Attributes, with 1 additional point to distribute as you please.

#### Skills & Vitials
3. Put 3 Points into your Skills, Distribute them as you please. see [[here.|meta.guide#logic-primal-and-instinct]]

4. Mark down your HP which is Base HP + Vitality (VIT)

5. Mark down your Initiative which is Dexterity (DEX) + Alert.

6. Mark down your Will which is Insight (INS) + 2. Mark those down.

The amount of moves you can learn is INS + 2 (same as Will.)

If you're following along for the base PMD module? Congrats (not included in this quick guide, Primal, Logic, and Instinct)! If it's for my Homebrew. Keep scrollin' y'ain't done yet.

#### Logic Primal and Instinct
For Logic, Primal, and Instinct, follow the rules from the [[meta.homebrewold]]. They will also be listed below. ^lpi
