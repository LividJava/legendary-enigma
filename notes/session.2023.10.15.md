## Planning
Akko has turned face, and so begins her slow corruption. But in the meantime, a new town unfolds!

 - The Medallion has links to Bobert.
 - The letter will provide clues as to who is behind the bigger picture.
 - Akko will have a fight with herself, but it should be subtle, to build out over time.
 - Make way into Town to do some information gathering.

### Possible Information:  
 - A bandit camp with ties
 - Mysterious voices and figures being heard and seen at night
 - A red herring as to where Vincent might be (its just a ditto but the ditto may know more than it lets on)
 - Murmurings of a Legendary. (Ho-Oh?)


## Notes
Boris the Merchant.  
Encountered the High Order.
