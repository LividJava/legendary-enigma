# Scope
The goal of this document is to integrate certain functions of the Pokerole system and the PMD Add-on module within the D&D 5E system. It will largely express the current problems I have with the current Pokerole system and hope to address them. This will be run in sections to explain each core concept of both 5E and Pokerole, how they are planned to be merged, as well as a conversion system for the Moves.

For context this will only assume the setting is for the PMD Add-on and all player characters will be assuming the role of Pokemon.

# Character Creation
For the process of character creation, you'll largely follow the process of 5E for creating a character. Depending on your DM's preference of either Point Buy or Rolls. 

There are exceptions. Due to the nature of Magic using classes and Pokemon, it's advised that they be avoided where possible. As most magic casting could be replaced for Pokemon using Moves.

## Character Conversion
If you already have a character. You'll need to make a character from scratch effectively. Work with your DM to see what level you'd start at, what bonuses (if any) can be applied to character creation, and other things such as that. Your Character concept should remain largely unaffected.

# Pokemon Moves
This will heavily utilize the Pokerole rulebook, with adaptations to 5E See the table below for Equivalent Stats.

|Pokerole|D&D 5E|
|-:|:-|
|Strength|Strength|
|Dexterity|Dexterity|
|Vitality|Constitution|
|Special|Intelligence|
|Insight|Wisdom|
|Social Attributes[^1]|Charisma|
[^1]:Social attributes in this case are **Tough**, **Cool**, **Beauty**, **Cute**, and **Clever**. These are all rolled into the Charisma stat.

The moves a pokemon may learn are equal to their CL + WIS.
The Level of theses moves are also determined by CL.


# 5E Specific Stats
For this, Use [This site](https://pokedex-5e.herokuapp.com/) but ignore references to Moves, this is an incomplete list.


[^2]:*[CL]: Character Level 
*[WIS]: Wisdom Modifier
*[DC]: Difficulty Class
