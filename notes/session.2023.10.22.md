## Planning
Players approach the new town of [[places.nebulinvalley]]

### Possible Information
- Crops are being poached or burned
- Murmurings of a Legendary Sighting
- A local shift in weather
- Voices and Figures being seen at night

#### Crop Scorching
Players will enter the bar and with a sufficient roll will hear that a local, Mari (Lilligant), is having troubles keeping her berry orchard from growing. The saplings keep wilting and dying.

If accepted the players will be taken to Mari's grove where they will with a sufficient roll, find evidence of scorching and intentional sabatoage, however subtle it may be. With an exceptional roll and upon closer examination, it might seem that it's actually unintentionally. a youngling not fully in control.

Asking around, They will find a small hatchling Torchic (Pip), Pip generally means no harm, and he's very apologetic. He was just looking around but accicentally lit aflame the crops. But for him that was the one time. He hadn't been back after the initial incident in fear of being admonished.

The players will need to find a way to eventually track down the intenional sabotager. A group of Sizzlipede's (4) (Scorch, Ash, Cinder and Sear). Who are intentionally Sabotaging Mari's farm to drive local trade up maliciously. They can be defeated by either Diplomacy being made to see the err of their ways or defeated in combat. If lethal, this will have bigger concequences, if non-lethal, the group will stop entirelly in fear of being hit again.


#### Phase Shift
The Localized weather change is due to Bridgette's unknown Phase Change ability. The group when not around her will notice it's warmer. When around her will notice it's colder. If investigated, the effects will vanish.


#### Nightly Haunts
There are Murmurings of voices at night? What's going on?




#### Points of Interest
- [[places.dacapo]]
- Adventurer's Outpost
