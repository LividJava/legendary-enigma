## History
Vincent is one of few Humans that reside in the Wondrous world, suffering from amnesia and unable to remember his life as a human, he opted to remain a pok√©mon as his memories remained to avail him. After waking up as a Human, He was found by [[Akko|people.npc.akko]] who would eventually guide him initally to a forgotten settlement which would eventually grow into the town known as [[Asterim|places.asterim]].

Vincent and Akko would go on to found the Rescue Team Novus. Helping out various people in need, be that saving them from the ever shifting dungeons, or helping with menial tasks. ^k7mwuwvspezc

He and Akko would split at some point to start the foundations of Asterim. While Akko would remain behind to manage the town as a surrogate mayor while he was away. Vincent and his team would go on to best several legendaries that threatened the land. ^y065g0plpzvf

Eventually he would discover the existence of the [[Fracture|world-fracture]], attempting to understand its existence and eventually sealing it away.

His current whereabouts are unknown.

## Personality
Vincent is reserved and clever. Always pausing to measure his words. He took a long time to trust his eventual teammates, the exception being Akko. While he is always willing to help those in need, he will not hesitate to fight those who present a threat or harm those close to him.

## Relationships
While he has few friends, the few he does have are close and know he's human.

### Akko
Vincent's relationship with Akko at first glance might seem to be romantic, but is actually one of deep appreciation. Akko was the first person to help him in an unknown world, showing him kindness despite his background. She is one of few people who know he is human.

Their time spent together as a rescue team was one built on deep understanding and trust. They would battle in tandem with one another and always seemed to be able to read one another's mind in battle. He trusts her with his life.
