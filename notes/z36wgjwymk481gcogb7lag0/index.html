<h2 id="history">History<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#history"></a></h2>
<p>The RTA was founded as the need for rescue teams rose.

It quickly became apparent that those who were not RTA members would have a harder time if they wanted to make it as a rescue team.</p>
<p>Eventually there would be an appointed board that would manage fees, and other administrative tasks. Board members were voted onto the board with no set term length, they could be voted off and replaced. Most board members would either Retire or were K.I.A. before being voted off.</p>
<p>While rescue teams were running seemingly rampant with a new one every day, the RTA provided a sense of relief among the general populace. Policing members, and ensuring they adhere to a code of conduct. The mission statement being "Always help within your means. Don't over do it."</p>
