The World Fracture is the Final event of the campaign. It is the anthesis of all things bad in the universe. It is the balance point that keeps this island afloat, and is the very core of it's existance. 

The World Fracture itself should **not** exist in this space. As it's existance *causes* [[The Great Catastrophes|great-catastrophes]]. It appears when there is a "human" presence. That "human" presence can take several forms:
- The corrupted mind of a Pokémon (by humans).
- The physical presence of a human being.
- The observation of Undr Öld by humans

The above is a Non-exhaustive list. The one exception is a human in the form of a Pokémon, Humans as pokémon are an anomoly to this, it is though that when the Wondrous World is in peril, the World Fracture will call upon the soul of a human being to take heed and save it. However, in doing so, the human soul risks losing their humanity as a side effect of the World Fracture, and must actively fight to maintain their humanity.

## Shadow Pokémon
These Pokémon exist as a result of *surges* from the World Fracture. They do not come from existing pokémon but are rather "born" of the fracture, they are sometimes known as "Void Children". They appear as normal pokémon but with an ever present shadow miasma. Encountering such a creature is said to be devastating, there are few that live to tell such tales of them, and the ones that do are haggard, battle scarred, and swore off fighting after meeting them. Calling them lifeless, soulless creatures hell bent on destroying whatever stands infront of them.
