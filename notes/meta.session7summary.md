Our story has already begun, but lets talk about things that have happened so far.

We begin in the Hoenn Region, in the quaint town of Littleroot, in the lab of Professor Birch. Papers are strewn about everywhere with Aides milling about steering clear of the professor's desk. Said professor can be seen pulling papers at seemingly random from various stacks and collating them.

He murmurs to himself "What a strange island, It's as though it doesn't want to be observed."

He pulls a folder off the top of another stack "It seems efforts to visit the island were met with some disaster. For safety sake all sponsored research to the island has been suspended indefinitely."

Birch proceeds to tap his chin, "Interestingly it seems that Pokemon can travel freely to and from the island. It makes me wonder what kind of Pokemon live in that secluded place"

We rush out to sea wizzing past various Pokemon traveling towards the island in question. Seemingly in migration. We pass through an enshrouded daunting storm, winds that would rip sails asunder and waves that seem to say You shouldn't be here. Passing through the dense clouds, with torrental rains, and hail. Getting to the other side, we see our Wondrous island. Lush rolling hills ascending to the mountains and edge of the island. We can see various huts sparsely dotting the landscape showing signs of life and civilization.

Our story began on The Shores of Memories, where-in Two unlikely Humans would find voids in their memories. A former Attorney General in the form of a small and might Axew, and a former illegal underground fighter trainer, turned into the very pokemon they betrayed. Both seeking to right their wrongs, find who they were, and confront the past. They would go on to encounter a scheming Meowth, scamming the locals out of their cash by selling mundane human items and passing them off as valuable relics. 

A simple task as most on the island had never even seen a human before. Wanting to get the two out of her hair she would take them to the local settlement of Duskalos in the Lunwood forest, with Duskalos acting as a Port Town, bringing in all sorts of new things collected from the Human Lands.

In Duskalos they would encounter a Vulpix, stolen away from her home, kidnapped being a prized contest pokemon, and saved by an unknown force ended up sneaking around in town trying to find her own way back home to her beloved companion.

The four would form an Adventurer's Guild team. To access the various resources of the guild, earn money, and set off on their own respective journeys together, to help eachother reach their own goals. Taking on a delivery, to bring something to Duskpeak, a trade town importing things from Duskalos, and redistributing it across the Island. On the way, the party would encounter a Shinx, fallen in a pit seemingly to be murdered.

The Shinx was on their own task, to gather information about an unruly character. Shinx was saved and would travel along side the party for the time being, some not being as trustful of the small shinx as others. As shinx would fight their own identity issues being a Human as well.

Eventually arriving in Dusk Peak, they would complete their delivery when strange things would begin to happen. Shinx would go on to a holy site, and a grand bell would ring out, not audibly but in the minds of the party. The Ferrier of souls would appear before Shinx and a Pact would be made. And as tensions rose between the group, acusations flying to and from. A Zorua would crash into the party running from his theviery for the enjoyment of touching cou, finding himself face to face with the Law, his last chance burned out, and adventuring with this group as his only means for redemption. Lest he be ostracized by all the settlements within the island.

It's here the party will learn of the Great Disasters, events that happened before, history repeating itself the very island rejecting itself, destroying. They would learn of the World Fracture, developing because of the influence of human greed and sin corrupting the minds of those on the island. They would learn of the Sky Bell, a saving grace to abate the oncoming disasters, and how the very item to save them, is doomed itself. Being tasked with a heedy quest, to save the island, and in so doing, maybe, reach their own goals.

The party begins to set off for the Triam Mountain range, needing to seek out information of a lost legend, and how to prevent the home of a budding pokemon civilization from ending.

A Charmander, seeking to be forgiven for his sins.
An Axew, seeking justice by any means.
A Meowth, looking to cash in.
A Vulpix, finding a way back.
A Shinx, trying to find themselves, and escape their past.
A Zorua, hunting the greatest heist.

With that, you're all caught up.
