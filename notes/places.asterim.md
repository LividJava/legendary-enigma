One of the main settlements of the world. A settlement of new beginnings for up and coming adventurers! A long time ago it originally housed the [[Rescue Team Alliance|organizations.rescue-team-alliance]] \(AKA. RTA), the organization that kept track of Rescue teams, their ranks, members, and a number of other house keeping items.

Asterim was lost in [[The Great Tremor|great-catastrophes.tremor]], as a large part of the settlement resided on unstable land. It originally was not an issue at the time of it's foundation as earthquakes were minimal at best, and times they did occur the damange was negligable.
