The Great catastrophes are a series of events that happen in no particualar order, but when they do occur they *all* have some form of devestating, and sometimes, irrepariable damage. They may never cause the island itself to sink but they can cause massive changes to the land itself depending on the nature.

The Great Catastrophes are an anomolous result of the appearance of the [[World Fracture|world-fracture]].
