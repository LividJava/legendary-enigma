If you have any questions at any point about certain mechanics please let me know and I will do my best to explain them! Things may change as we play! It can be confusing for all of us, but I will attempt to streamline the game as best as possible so we can have the most fun possible!</p>\n<h1 id=\"combat\">Combat<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#combat\"></a></h1>\n<p>Combat is a harsh pill to swallow and this game is made on a non grid system. Mostly using Theater of the Mind, and not regarding any logic to actual movement/range whatsoever, I have changed this so it is more in-line with traditional TTRPG Mechanics. This may change as I notice balance issues arise.</p>\n<p>First up. Movement Speed. Your movement speed is equal to your Size class. The categories are as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>Effective Height</th><th>Size Class</th><th>Speed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2 Feet and Under</td><td>Tiny</td><td>20 Ft.</td></tr><tr><td>2 to 3 Feet</td><td>Small</td><td>25 Ft.</td></tr><tr><td>3 to 5 Feet</td><td>Medium</td><td>30 Ft.</td></tr><tr><td>6 Feet and Above</td><td>Large</td><td>35 Ft.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<br>\nIn Addition to this, if your character has the ability to fly, Add an Additional 5 foot of movement speed. And you gain the Size class speed as your flight speed. (For example. If you are an Emolga, You are Tiny, you have a Movement speed of 25 because you can fly. Your Fly Speed is 20)\n<h2 id=\"moving-in-combat\">Moving in Combat<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#moving-in-combat\"></a></h2>\n<p>You may <em>Dash</em> (full movements) equal to your Dexterity score to a max of 5 (so if you have 6 dex, you can only make 5 dashes). Movement will take priority over all actions, making subsequent actions harder. You can elect to move at the end of your turn. But you can only move normally.</p>\n<p>For Example:\nYour Dex is 2. Your Movement speed is 30. You can make 60 total movement, and that counts as 2/5 actions for this particular round.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attacking-move-range\">Attacking Move range<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#attacking-move-range\"></a></h2>\n<p>Physical moves have a range of 5 feet.\nPhys + Multi foes are 10 feet\nIf a move is labeled as ranged, it has 30 feet.</p>\n<p>Special Moves have a range of 60 feet.\nSpec + Multi foes are an additional +10ft per foe (unless its all in range in which case 80 ft)</p>\n<p>Moves that target the battlefield are a 90 ft. radius.</p>\n<h1 id=\"saving-throws\">Saving Throws<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#saving-throws\"></a></h1>\n<p>Sometimes when the going gets rough, you need to lay all the cards out on the table.</p>\n<p>Saving throws are rolls that are to be used when doing risky things. Jumping off a cliff, or putting everything into a single attack! These rolls will always be a Raw attribute roll, and it is the only roll where you add up all the face values of the dice (No pass/fail).</p>\n<h1 id=\"skill-checks\">Skill Checks<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#skill-checks\"></a></h1>\n<p>A Skill check consists of one to two components. Generally an Attribute/Social Attribute and/or a Skill. When rolling the dice, Add the two pools together, roll the necessary dice, and call out how many successes you’ve obtained.</p>\n<p>A Skill Check will <strong>ALWAYS</strong> be at least 1 Attribute and/or Skill. They can be more for a <strong>MAX</strong> of 2 pools. In some cases it can be 2 attributes or skills.</p>\n<p>This flexibility allows you to try things that aren’t listed on your sheet as written! Say you want to try to determine what move a Pokémon just used! You can attempt a \"Magic\" check by combining Special + Channel!</p>\n<p>If you want to try something weird go for it! I will generally let you know what you need to roll!</p>\n<p>Achieving all successes (where all the dice read successes), is considered a Critical Success (Equivalent to a Nat 20).</p>\n<h2 id=\"critical-success\">Critical Success<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#critical-success\"></a></h2>\n<p><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link\" id=\"^ww33jdu5l3j4\" href=\"#^ww33jdu5l3j4\"></a>On a skill check, Achieving Successes on All of your Dice, is considered the equivalent to a Natural 20 in D&#x26;D terms. This only applies to rolls where you roll 3 or more dice. </p>\n<p><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link\" id=\"^aor8ncn2ouqy\" href=\"#^aor8ncn2ouqy\"></a>For example, If you roll a skill check for stealth, but only have 2 dice to roll, you cannot critically succeed.\nAnother example. If you roll a skill check for Perception (Insight + Nature). And have 4 dice to roll, you can critically succeed! </p>\n<h1 id=\"logic-instinct-and-primal\">Logic, Instinct, and Primal<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#logic-instinct-and-primal\"></a></h1>\n<p>This section of the PMD Module is outdated as the module was originally made for 1.0 of the Pokerole rule set. I am following a homebrew ruleset to bring this more in line with 2.0.</p>\n<h2 id=\"logic\">Logic<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#logic\"></a></h2>\n<p>Firstly, Logic is now used to help determine the amount of dice you need for Logic based skill roles (Medical checks, Weaponry checks, Etc.) Everyone starts off with a single point in this field.</p>\n<h2 id=\"instinct\">Instinct<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#instinct\"></a></h2>\n<p>Instinct will now affect multiple things! For starters, The amount of ranks you have in Instinct will determine what level of moves you can learn (1 for starter, 2 for beginner, 3 for amateur, 4 for ace, and 5 for pro). You can also use Instinct in place of a Nature check for Food or Shelter (only in this case). </p>\n<p>Finally the amount of Instinct points you have will determine how much HP you recover when using a point of Primal. Everyone starts with a single point in this field.</p>\n<p>You get an additional point to place in either Logic or Instinct as you please.</p>\n<h2 id=\"primal\">Primal<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#primal\"></a></h2>\n<p>Primal has the biggest revamp. Rather than a game-ender as written in the PMD module it is now a resource you can pull on when your back is against the wall.</p>\n<p>Everyone is down, you’re the last one standing in the face of this monster, you’re beaten and bloodied, but you must survive. You pull on something deep within you, disobeying everything in you to run, you take a deep breath, scream as if to defy the world itself, and take your last stand.</p>\n<p>Everyone starts with 0 Primal. You add 1 to Primal as you spend a point, to a max of 5. When spending a point you regain HP equal to your Instinct score and clear all status conditions.</p>\n<p><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link\" id=\"^dvatxa0csgoe\" href=\"#^dvatxa0csgoe\"></a>If you use all 5 points of Primal. In the round you triggered it you will pass out when everything resolves. </p>\n<h1 id=\"common-skill-checks\">Common Skill Checks<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#common-skill-checks\"></a></h1>\n<h1 id=\"custom-actions\">Custom Actions<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#custom-actions\"></a></h1>\n<p>Below are a list of custom actions used in the campaign that everyone has access to.</p>\n<h2 id=\"snap-out-of-it\">Snap out of it!<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#snap-out-of-it\"></a></h2>\n<p>Once per round, you may attempt to snap a party member out of their confusion or infatuation by attempting a non-damaging slap to them. <code>Insight + Alert</code> Success DC equal to the initial accuracy of the move.</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/b8d1ulxqfmw4klch1gri9c2\">Making a PMD Character</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"zh6cgxgxdu3u8nosydll2ik","title":"The Wondrous World","desc":"","updated":1689835890467,"created":1666316457940,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"pmdwiki"},"contentHash":"931ed9ab600cea7accc3522385df534b","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"zh6cgxgxdu3u8nosydll2ik","vaultName":"pmdwiki"},"value":"places","alias":"World","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1,"offset":698},"end":{"line":15,"column":17,"offset":714},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"places"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"zh6cgxgxdu3u8nosydll2ik","vaultName":"pmdwiki"},"value":"people","alias":"People","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1,"offset":762},"end":{"line":17,"column":18,"offset":779},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"people"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"zh6cgxgxdu3u8nosydll2ik","vaultName":"pmdwiki"},"value":"great-catastrophes","alias":"The Great Catastrophes","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":1,"offset":840},"end":{"line":19,"column":46,"offset":885},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"great-catastrophes"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"zh6cgxgxdu3u8nosydll2ik","vaultName":"pmdwiki"},"value":"world-fracture","alias":"The World Fracture","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1,"offset":927},"end":{"line":22,"column":38,"offset":964},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"world-fracture"}}],"anchors":{"outline":{"type":"header","text":"Outline","value":"outline","line":20,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["wf0akia7teumrr2uz9ahcai","mbgjs3d1copv01e81nxy0nf","s75uxhz7wr8b0mzu8my18j1","7fcovynnlt7sbqti1o0ne8m","meudvewf5oo11wq8mhf0kym","khgpw5bddn489lsbeqtz6t3","d7a07o909u98ua8nikc8cxf","68b3yfsvjy3nurxncttcj2g","u58ow4ovj4xck7qhnvmyvnc"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"![pmdlogo.png](assets/pmdlogo.png){max-width: 195px, float: left, margin: 20px}\n\nThe world of Undr Öld - in english, The Wondrous World!
