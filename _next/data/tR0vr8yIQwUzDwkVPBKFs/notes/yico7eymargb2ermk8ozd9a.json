Following a similar structure to it and effectively adopting it's <a href=\"/notes/z36wgjwymk481gcogb7lag0#code-of-conduct\">code of conduct</a>, they've made a few notable changes, most notably in how guild meetings are structured.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changes\">Changes<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#changes\"></a></h2>\n<p>The most notable change is to the Guild Meeting voting structure, as Guild Teams are not required to assign a leader, teams will first have to come to a decision within ones own group, then once a decision has been made that party will then forward the majority as 1 vote. If they cannot come to a conclusive decision they will be considered as abstaining.</p>\n<p>While this does bloat on highly contentious matters, it does give small teams with no true lead, the option to participate in these matters.</p>\n<p>Votes are collected in the span of 2 days after a matter is presented, The first day Leadless teams will be given time to vote. If they do not submit within this limit they will be counted as abstaining. On the second day, Leaders of Teams will gather and vote then. Votes are counted and movements will be passed or rejected.</p>\n<p>It should be noted, all matters will be presented in one day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notable-teams\">Notable Teams<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#notable-teams\"></a></h2>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/s75uxhz7wr8b0mzu8my18j1\">Organizations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/ruzb0ayzic5qib2tr8gm4di\">Holly</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"zh6cgxgxdu3u8nosydll2ik","title":"The Wondrous World","desc":"","updated":1689835890467,"created":1666316457940,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"pmdwiki"},"contentHash":"931ed9ab600cea7accc3522385df534b","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"zh6cgxgxdu3u8nosydll2ik","vaultName":"pmdwiki"},"value":"places","alias":"World","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1,"offset":698},"end":{"line":15,"column":17,"offset":714},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"places"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"zh6cgxgxdu3u8nosydll2ik","vaultName":"pmdwiki"},"value":"people","alias":"People","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1,"offset":762},"end":{"line":17,"column":18,"offset":779},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"people"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"zh6cgxgxdu3u8nosydll2ik","vaultName":"pmdwiki"},"value":"great-catastrophes","alias":"The Great Catastrophes","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":1,"offset":840},"end":{"line":19,"column":46,"offset":885},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"great-catastrophes"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"zh6cgxgxdu3u8nosydll2ik","vaultName":"pmdwiki"},"value":"world-fracture","alias":"The World Fracture","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1,"offset":927},"end":{"line":22,"column":38,"offset":964},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"world-fracture"}}],"anchors":{"outline":{"type":"header","text":"Outline","value":"outline","line":20,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["wf0akia7teumrr2uz9ahcai","mbgjs3d1copv01e81nxy0nf","s75uxhz7wr8b0mzu8my18j1","7fcovynnlt7sbqti1o0ne8m","meudvewf5oo11wq8mhf0kym","khgpw5bddn489lsbeqtz6t3","d7a07o909u98ua8nikc8cxf","68b3yfsvjy3nurxncttcj2g","u58ow4ovj4xck7qhnvmyvnc"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"![pmdlogo.png](assets/pmdlogo.png){max-width: 195px, float: left, margin: 20px}\n\nThe world of Undr Öld - in english, The Wondrous World!
