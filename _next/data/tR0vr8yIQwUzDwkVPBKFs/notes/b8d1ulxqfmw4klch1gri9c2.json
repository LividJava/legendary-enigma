They will also be listed below. </p>\n<p></p><p></p><div class=\"portal-container\">\n<div class=\"portal-head\">\n<div class=\"portal-backlink\">\n<div class=\"portal-title\">From <span class=\"portal-text-title\">Homebrew Add-on</span></div>\n<a href=\"/notes/zw8zreiygnsgd6vsoayjpsf\" class=\"portal-arrow\">Go to text <span class=\"right-arrow\">→</span></a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"portal-parent-anchor\" class=\"portal-parent\" markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"portal-parent-fader-top\"></div>\n<div class=\"portal-parent-fader-bottom\"></div><h2 id=\"logic\">Logic<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#logic\"></a></h2>\n<p>Firstly, Logic is now used to help determine the amount of dice you need for Logic based skill roles (Medical checks, Weaponry checks, Etc.) Everyone starts off with a single point in this field.</p>\n<h2 id=\"instinct\">Instinct<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#instinct\"></a></h2>\n<p>Instinct will now affect multiple things! For starters, The amount of ranks you have in Instinct will determine what level of moves you can learn (1 for starter, 2 for beginner, 3 for amateur, 4 for ace, and 5 for pro). You can also use Instinct in place of a Nature check for Food or Shelter (only in this case). </p>\n<p>Finally the amount of Instinct points you have will determine how much HP you recover when using a point of Primal. Everyone starts with a single point in this field.</p>\n<p>You get an additional point to place in either Logic or Instinct as you please.</p>\n<h2 id=\"primal\">Primal<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#primal\"></a></h2>\n<p>Primal has the biggest revamp. Rather than a game-ender as written in the PMD module it is now a resource you can pull on when your back is against the wall.</p>\n<p>Everyone is down, you’re the last one standing in the face of this monster, you’re beaten and bloodied, but you must survive. You pull on something deep within you, disobeying everything in you to run, you take a deep breath, scream as if to defy the world itself, and take your last stand.</p>\n<p>Everyone starts with 0 Primal. You add 1 to Primal as you spend a point, to a max of 5. When spending a point you regain HP equal to your Instinct score and clear all status conditions.</p>\n<p><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link\" id=\"^dvatxa0csgoe\" href=\"#^dvatxa0csgoe\"></a>If you use all 5 points of Primal. In the round you triggered it you will pass out when everything resolves. </p>\n</div></div><p></p><p></p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/b8d1ulxqfmw4klch1gri9c2\">Making a PMD Character</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"zh6cgxgxdu3u8nosydll2ik","title":"The Wondrous World","desc":"","updated":1689835890467,"created":1666316457940,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"pmdwiki"},"contentHash":"931ed9ab600cea7accc3522385df534b","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"zh6cgxgxdu3u8nosydll2ik","vaultName":"pmdwiki"},"value":"places","alias":"World","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1,"offset":698},"end":{"line":15,"column":17,"offset":714},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"places"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"zh6cgxgxdu3u8nosydll2ik","vaultName":"pmdwiki"},"value":"people","alias":"People","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1,"offset":762},"end":{"line":17,"column":18,"offset":779},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"people"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"zh6cgxgxdu3u8nosydll2ik","vaultName":"pmdwiki"},"value":"great-catastrophes","alias":"The Great Catastrophes","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":1,"offset":840},"end":{"line":19,"column":46,"offset":885},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"great-catastrophes"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"zh6cgxgxdu3u8nosydll2ik","vaultName":"pmdwiki"},"value":"world-fracture","alias":"The World Fracture","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1,"offset":927},"end":{"line":22,"column":38,"offset":964},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"world-fracture"}}],"anchors":{"outline":{"type":"header","text":"Outline","value":"outline","line":20,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["wf0akia7teumrr2uz9ahcai","mbgjs3d1copv01e81nxy0nf","s75uxhz7wr8b0mzu8my18j1","7fcovynnlt7sbqti1o0ne8m","meudvewf5oo11wq8mhf0kym","khgpw5bddn489lsbeqtz6t3","d7a07o909u98ua8nikc8cxf","68b3yfsvjy3nurxncttcj2g","u58ow4ovj4xck7qhnvmyvnc"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"![pmdlogo.png](assets/pmdlogo.png){max-width: 195px, float: left, margin: 20px}\n\nThe world of Undr Öld - in english, The Wondrous World!
